## Source code

```cpp
www
- /home/sys_*/www
\endverbatim

Manifest file names should end with <b>.mft</b>

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_vhq_manifest VHQ Manifest

- New dlfile.mfg (packaged into dlfile.mft.tgz as part of the dlfile.tar)
- JSON formatted file similar to Engage.mfg on VOS2
    - Some field will be different
- dlfile.mfg will be auto-generated by packman - no need to add Engage.mfg manually

\subsection subsec_vos3_adk_mac_compatibility ADK MAC (Multi-application Controller)

\warning MAC is a mandatory component on VOS3. \n Any application on VOS3 needs to provide a corresponding MAC manifest file to configure the appliaction for launching. \n This allows also to let MAC launch applications automatically to avoid manual start from MAC desktop.

MAC is a display controller daemon. It provides application developers a way to start/stop applications and controls treir visibility.

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_mac_api_compatibility API compatibility

All APIs supported as on VOS1/VOS2.

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_launching_mac Launching via Multi-Application Controller (MAC)

With VOS3 all applications get launched using the Multi-Application Controller. This enables:

- auto-launching of applications and services
- manual launch from desktop
- assignment of UI resources for applications
- switching between applications
- access to system control panels

\warning There is no support outside of MAC launching for applications. \n Applications should use following API for that: \n   - sysLaunchApp() - run application by it's name in manifest file \n - sysLaunchAppid() - run application by it's identifier in manifest file

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_mac_hotkey_combinations Hotkey combinations

Key combination |Action
----------------|-------
X + 1           |starts Control Panel
X + 3           |shows MAC Desktop
1 + 5 + 9       |shows MAC Desktop
1 + 5 + 9 (on MAC desktop)|sysmode is no more available on VOS3!

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_mac_manifests Manifests

Application developers describe how MAC should handle their applications by providing a manifest file.

Manifests are text files, whose names ends with .mft

Manifest is accepted in JSON or INI data formats, as it was on previous VOS versions.

MAC is looking for manifest files in the following locations:

\verbatim
- /home/usr*/www
- /home/sys_*/www
\endverbatim

MAC manifest example:
\code
[application]
id=mac_demo1
version=3.83.15
statusbar=y
app_resource_dir=mac_demo1
depends=mac_demo2;mac_demo3;
recover=n

[desktop]
label=mac_demo1
icon=mac_demo1/default/verifone-icon.png
cmdline=../mac_demo1
args=r1d2 r2d3

[autolaunch]
cmdline=../mac_demo1
start_hidden=y
\endcode

\warning MAC manifest is not the same thing as installable package manifest.

\subsection subsec_vos3_adk_log_compatibility ADK-LOG (Logging)

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_log_api_compatibility API compatibility

All APIs supported as on VOS1/VOS2.


\subsection subsec_vos3_adk_ipc_compatibility ADK-IPC (Inter-Process Communication)

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_ipc_api_compatibility API compatibility

All APIs supported as on VOS1/VOS2.


\subsection subsec_vos3_adk_inf_compatibility ADK-INF (Information Database Service)

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_inf_api_compatibility API compatibility

All APIs supported as on VOS1/VOS2.


\subsection subsec_vos3_adk_evt_compatibility ADK-EVT (Event Service)

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_evt_api_compatibility API compatibility

All APIs supported as on VOS1/VOS2.


\subsection subsec_vos3_adk_com_compatibility ADK-COM (Network Setup and Communications)

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_com_api_compatibility API compatibility

In general all ADK-COM APIs are supported same way as on previous VOS1/VOS2 platform.

Following deprecations/extensions are applicable for VOS3:

- any analogue modem related device properties and connection profiles are not supported
    - e.g. COM_PROP_RAW_MODEM_CURRENT_MODULATION
- no support for external BC reader using USB HID
    - i.e. serial connection profile with por BC_READER. Serial devices using dynUSB can still be used.
- not supported API support for STunnel on VOS3. This configuration option for a "2-piece" PIN pad use-case is replaced by SDI EPP/EPM.
    - com_SetStunnelConfig
- new APIs for iBeacon- recommended to be used with VOS3
    - com_IBeaconGetAdvertisement()
    - com_IBeaconSetAdvertisement()
    - com_IBeaconStartAdvertisement()
    - com_IBeaconStopAdvertisement()
- new APIs for Eddystone Beacon - recommended to be used with VOS3
    - com_EddystoneURLGetAdvertisementExt()
    - com_EddystoneURLSetAdvertisementExt()
    
\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_com_and_network_descriptors Communication and Network Descriptors

VOS3 continues to use the same format and parameter for ADK connection and network profiles.
Exeption: connection and network profiles for modem (MDM_INT, BT_DUN) and external barcode reader (BC_READER).

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_com_custom_cert_loading Custom Certificate Loading and pre-loaded authentication key

VOS3 will no longer support loading certificates for TLS, Wifi EAP and LAN 802.1x using PKCS#12 files. 

The system now supports secure loading of these certificates using VRKv2. The loaded certificates will be stored securely in the system and can be referenced by the SSL_OWN_CERT and SSL_OWN_KEY parameter with "vault:<keyname>" in the related connection profile for TLS or network profile for Wifi or LAN. The <keyname> needs to match the name of the loaded certificate / key used in the VRKv2 package.

The preloaded Authentication Key (Authex/ AuthN) / warranty key can be referenced using "vault:" as a name for SSL_OWN_CERT and SSL_OWN_PKEY.

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_com_network_startup Network Startup and Recovery handling

Unlike VOS1/VOS2, the VOS3 system always implements an auto start and recovery for configured networks. With this the VOS3 system will always:

- BT: try to re-establish connection via BT-PAN to the previously connected device when coming back in range
- Wifi: try to re-establish Wifi connection to the previously connected SSID or other in-range configured SSID when coming back in range
- Cellular: try to re-establish connection to the previously connected mobile network
- LAN: try to re-establish connection to the previously connected LAN network

The previous support for manual configuration of recovery handling using load packages is deprecated (previous: dl.comcfg-no-rc-1.0.0.tgz and dl.comcfg-no-rc-remove-1.0.0.tgz packages).

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_com_network_diagnose_functions Network Diagnose Functions

Comunication Control Panel (CCP) supports network diagnose (ping sequence, NSLookup, connection test to remote host, extended http server tests).

CCP also supports manual network restart for trouble shooting.

Since VOS3 no longer supports Sysmode, CCP needs to be extended by a couple of diagnostics and communication related information previously provided by VOS2 Sysmode.


\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_com_changes_in_config_files Changes in configuration files

Any user generated configuration for ADK-COM / CCP need to be regenerated with the new VOS3 packaging system using type flashconfig. e.g. the location is changed to /mnt/appdata/versioned/globalshare/etc/config/adk-com.


\subsection subsec_vos3_adk_guiprt_compatibility ADK-GUIPRT (HTML Rendering, Video playback, Barcode Scanner)

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_guiprt_api_compatibility API compatibility

All APIs supported as on VOS1/VOS2.

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_guiprt_html_css_resource_files HTML / CSS Resource files

- As on VOS1/VOS2 resource files are expected to be stored in www in the home of the user. Depending on manifest configuration this is
    - /home/<user>/www/<resourcedir>
    - /home/<user>/www/<appdir>/<resourcedir>
- <appdir> depends on MAC manifest configuration
- <resourcedir> is handled the same way as on VOS1/VOS2, it can be the model name (e.g. P630) or based on display resolution and keypad, e.g. 320x480C15T
- Since VOS3 no longer is using Grsecurity, setting up file permissions when packaging resource files is slightly different as on VOS1/VOS2: Files need to be in group share instead of group system.
    - Using makepackage3 use "--group share"
    - Directly preparing a Packman manifest, it looks like this:
    
\code
    {
   "name":"demo",
   "version":"1.2.3",
   "user":"usr1",
   "software_platforms":["vos3"],
   "packages":[{
      "name":"executable",
      "type":"user_ro"
   },{
      "name":"resource",
      "group":"share",
      "type":"user_ro"
   }],
   "signers":["SPONSOR"]
    }
\endcode

\note group "share" shares the resource files with all users. Depending on context, group "usr1sys" ("usr2sys" for usr2, ...)  may also be used.
    
\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_guiprt_video_files Video files

As on VOS1/VOS2 mplayer is used for playing videos. The supported video formats depend on those supported by mplayer.

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_guiprt_barcode Barcode scanning

Barcode scanning works the same as on VOS1/VOS2 (use <input type="barcode" ....>)

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_guiprt_adding_fonts Adding fonts

Fonts may be installed using font packages. For this set the type of the package to "font_ro". This takes care of generating the required fonts.dir file so that the font can be found later on.


\subsection subsec_vos3_adk_prx_compatibility ADK-PRX (CPR proxy to access Verifone webservices)

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_prx_prequisites Prerequisites
- VOS3 support added with version 3.0.5
- Requires at least ADKIPC 1.26.0

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_prx_compatibility Compatibility
- API compatibility: Pure service, no APIs as on VOS1/VOS2
- Interface compatibility: All interfaces (listen port, config interface) supported as on VOS1/VOS2
- Package format: Package format changed, but same naming for base and activation packages
- Features: Same code base as on VOS1/VOS2, thus, the same features are provided

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_prx_cg_endpoints No support for old CG endpoints

- Support for old CG endpoints (dev.cgateway.verifone.com, test.cgateway.verifone.com, staging1.cgateway.verifone.com, cgateway.verifone.com) was dropped. 
    \warning CG endpoints from now are deprecated!
- ADKPRX base package only installs GSC endpoints as default environments
- Last option to use CG endpoints with version 3.5.0 is the installation of an user config package on top of ADKPRX (sample user config package coming along with ADKPRX documentation)
    \note Customers are advised to do this for testing purposes only. Do NOT use old CG endpoints for productive installations, since old CG environment endpoints will go offline sooner or later.
- Old ADKs might can still use version 3.0.50 (VOS/VOS2 only), which still contains CG endpoints, but also these installations should move to GSC soon

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_prx_user_config_packages User config packages

- Cloudproxy uses the same configuration files for all platforms (VOS/VOS2 and VOS3)
- VOS3 platform uses a different package format and installation location on target
- Wheras VOS/VOS2 has used global folder \c /etc/config/proxy, on VOS3 configuration files are looked up under \c /home/usr<X>/proxy: At startup ADK cloudproxy checks for the existence of the folder with included files starting from \c usr1 up to \c usr16. If there are related files found under a specific user, this user directory is applied as source for user configuration files. This means, the first user providing the files wins, other users with higher user numbers will be ignored.
- Since VOS3 no longer is using Grsecurity, setting up file permissions when packaging files is slightly different as on VOS1/VOS2: User config packages must use group \c usr<X>sys with type \c user_ro (instead VOS/VOS2 has used group share and type \c config.

For details please read documentation coming along with package \c prx-doc-X.X.X-X.zip with the ADK Cloud Proxy release.


\subsection subsec_vos3_adk_snd_compatibility ADK-SND (Sound Playback)

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_snd_api_compatibility API compatibility

- All APIs supported as on VOS1/VOS2.
- Same WAV and MP3 files can be reused on VOS3.


\subsection subsec_vos3_adk_cards_compatibility ADK-Cards (Card Acceptance, Processing and EMV kernels)

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_cards_api_compatibility API compatibility

Migrating from VOS2 to VOS3 requires to migrate to Secure Data Interface (SDI) as SDI will be no longer an optional component on VOS3 systems. To simplify migration VOS3 introduced a new SDI client library (libSDIClient) that exports existing Cards/EMV APIs similar to ADK on VOS2. The provided VOS3 libSDIClient includes

- ADK_EMV CT functions
- ADK EMV CTLS functions
- ADK-MSR functions
- ADK-NFC functions
- ADK-TEC functions

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_cards_transparent_l1_card_reader_api Transparent L1 card reader access APIs

On VOS3 specifically the libSDIClient also provides the transparent L1 access together with loading a specific SDI Plugin for VOS3 called vos3-cards. 
This of course must not be loaded when using SDI in headed mode and/or with external connections. 
The SDI Plugin will add all the VOS/VOS2 APIs back on VOS3 and must be loaded / used in VOS3 application projects whenever transparent card reader access is required. 
All these legacy APIs for transparent access will then be available also in SDI environment on VOS3. 
Transaction data fetching functions (including cardholder sensitive data) such as EMV_CT_fetchTxnTags() or EMV_CTLS_fetchTxnTags() will also be fully supported when the specific vos3-cards plugin is loaded.

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_cards_acceptance_api Card Acceptance APIs (ADK-TEC)

Although ADK-TEC APIs will be moved forward too, it is recommended to be replaced by the SDI card detection. This is due to the nature of the architecture of VOS3 terminals where parallel access to physical readers is restricted due to the command response interface to the K81, which will result in a different timing. The underlying K81 on VOS3 (and Android systems) has a single serial connection to the K81 main processor, where access must be controlled and organized (e.g. by SDI). Polling from multiple application threads and tasks on various hardware pieces on K81 side, e.g. CT / CTLS / MSR and other K81 resources in parallel may result in deviations from VOS2. All ADK-TEC features are covered with the SDI card detection and can be used in the 23-01 (synchronous) and 23-03 (asynchronous) card detection. For details, please refer to the SDI documentation. Both commands (23-01 and 23-03) are of course part of the libSDIClient. Your ADK-TEC calls can be replaced by these functions.

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_cards_general_migration General migration strategy towards SDI

Currently the following type of solutions exist on VOS2:

- TYPE1: Plain ADK/VOS2 implementations, not making use of SDI today
- TYPE2: VOS2 implementations that are based on SDI and use the libSDIClient already, but still DO bypass SDI with direct ADK calls (i.e. do use not existing SDI functionality of ADK-CARDS )
- TYPE3: Implementations that are based on SDI and use the libSDIClient already but do NOT bypass SDI. Those implementations are also Android (Trinity and NEO) compliant

<ins>Migration for Type 1</ins>: As explained in detail above. Use libSDIClient and load the plugin. The APIs for card handling are available in the same way as in VOS1/VOS2. <b>You are getting the payment/sensitive data in clear as on VOS2. You can NOT make use of the SDI P2PE certification.</b> You may want to consider to migrate from ADK-TEC to the SDI Card Detection (23-01 / 23-03), which is part of the libSDIClient APIs.

<ins>Migration for TYPE 2</ins>: This is similar to TYPE 1. Instead of directly calling the VOS1/VOS2 ADK functions you will now simply call the counterpart functions of the libSDIClient (names and APIs will be the same), so nothing to do on application level. <b>The SDI plugin for VOS3 enables that you to get the payment/sensitive data in clear as on VOS2. You can NOT make use of the SDI P2PE certification.</b> You may want to consider to migrate from ADK-TEC to the SDI Card Detection (23-01 / 23-03), which is part of the libSDIClient.

<ins>Migration for TYPE 3</ins>: You are already fully compliant to SDI. Please do <b>NOT</b> load the new SDI Plugin for VOS3. This way sensitive data is protected. <b>You are NOT getting the payment/sensitive data in clear as on VOS2. You CAN make use of the SDI P2PE certification. There is no need to change your existing VOS/VOS2 SDI solution on VOS3.</b>


\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_cards_emv EMV L1/L2 Kernels on Neo Platforms (Android vs. VOS3)

The same type-approved EMV kernels for CT and CTLS (L1 and L2) are used on Neo HW platforms between VOS3 and Android operating systems. Thus the emv_allowed.xml and the emv_desired.xml can be used for both OS variants with the same kernels, same LOAs and same certifications. The emv_desired.xml configuration files on VOS3 has same format as on VOS1/VOS2.

<b>Note on P630 and P630-2 units:</b>

- earlier "P630" products had a different CTLS1 HW architecture compared to "P630-2" - for this reason new L1/L2 certifications are provided for P630-2 hardware
- VOS3 will only run on P630-2 units, while Android can run on both P630 and P630-2
- Please make sure you configure the correct L1/L2 kernels for VOS3 on P630-2

<b>All other future Neo devices that can run VOS3 or Android will share the same L1 and L2 approvals between VOS3 and Android/NEO as long as the hardware has not deviations in the CTLS L1 architecture.</b>

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_cards_customizations Customizations

SDI supports customizations with SDI plugins. These plugins enable extensions and specific card schemes handling.

\note <b>Customization Plugins</b> \n Customization Plugins for SDI can be provided to implement specific card processing extensions. \n Please work with Verifone Platform SW group on specific requirements and implementation plan.


\subsection subsec_vos3_adk_sec_compatibility ADK SEC (Security)

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_sec_api_compatibility API compatibility

- VOS3 will no longer support a compatibility layer for ADK-SEC 1.x APIs.
- VOS1/VOS2 ADK SEC transaction data APIs will no longer be supported with VOS3 - now implemented through SDI directly
- extended secSetKSId parameter for MSK handling (optional for non-MSK handling)

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_sec_sdi_as_sec_provider SDI as Security Provider on VOS3

Unlike VOS1/VOS2 the ADK SEC interface is provided through SDI service that works with the security processor directly for all security functions. There is no scapp2 daemon on VOS3.

Applications continue to link against libsec2.so as a client library and this library connects to SDI.

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_sec_key_identification Key Identification

Unlike VOS1/VOS2, keys in VOS3 are identified by a unique name. Keys are identified by a unique name across all loaded keys including pre-loaded warrantied keys.

The use of former VOS1/VOS2 key slot IDs as unique key names is not recommended but speaking key names are suggested.

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_sec_supported_schemas Supported Schemes and Algorithms - Comparing to VOS1/VOS2

When migrating from VOS1/2 to VOS3 the following changes needs to be considered when configuring security engines and related operations:

\note Supported Modules and Operations by Platform: ENC=secEncryptData, DEC=secDecryptData, SIG=secSign, VFY=secVerify, PIN=secRetrieveEncryptedPIN, UPD=secUpdateKey

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_sdi_sec_config_file SDI Security Configuration File

In general VOS3 continues to use the same sccfg.json security configuration file format as used in earlier VOS1/2 for SDI and ADK-SEC.

SDI security configuration needs to be adapted for VOS3. Following items need to be checked:

- key names (as per new unique name in the VRK loading package)
- security module type (as per above table)

Unlike VOS1/2 the security configuration file is no longer provided in the user home path of the application. For VOS3 the security configuration has to be loaded with SDI user config package.

\note <b>Key Usage Checks.</b> The secure processor performs key usage checks for each crypto operation. That means VRK payloads have to be provided with proper key usage and mode according their intended usage. Keys with improper settings will be rejected by operations.

\subsubsection subsubsec_vos3_vss_replacement Replacement for VSS Scripts

On VOS1/VOS2 Verifone Security Scripts (VSS) support was available and had been used by some applications for various security operations including
- direct key loading, key derivation
- PIN block generation
- custom encryption, MACing
- etc.

On VOS3 there is no support for no support for direct key loading, but VRK key loading is the default key loading mechnism.

However, if customizations are required, VOS3 provides new mechanisms for that purpose
- Verifone Customizable Crypt Interface (VCCI)
- Extended Key Management Mechanisms

\note <b>Customization Plugins.</b> Customization Plugins for SDI can be provided to implement specific key derivation or custom key management solution.

\subsection vos3_adk_oss_libraries Open Source libraries

In addition to ADK APIs, applications can use the following provided Open Source libraries directly from within applications.

|Libxml      |- libxml.so \n - libxml2.so  |all headers from libxml2|added in OSS release 1.9.1|

\subsection vos3_adk_secondary_lib_dependencies Secondary Library dependencies

Provided client libraries have additional dependencies that are usually not reflected to the applications and they are being resolved internally.

Applications should only link to the above libraries, unless told differently.

\subsection vos3_platform_internal_libraries VOS3 Platform internal libraries

\warning DO NOT USE INTERNAL LIBRARIES. The SDK contains additional libraries not listed above as supported ADK or Open Source libraries. These libraries do not expose public interfaces for applications and can be subject to change with new VOS3 releases. Please do not use these libraries directly!

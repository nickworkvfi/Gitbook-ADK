# Feature Enablement Token <a href="#fet_page" id="fet_page"></a>

# Introduction <a href="#fet_intro" id="fet_intro"></a>

Feature enablement is when a customer requests that an additional, optional feature be activated on their terminal. This is accomplished by the customer first obtaining the proper license to use the feature and the license file being downloaded by the terminal. All featured are pre-installed on terminals but are inactive until the terminal has the proper license. Once the license file has been downloaded, the OS will begin implementing the feature until the license file expires.

# FET Activation Process <a href="#fet_activation" id="fet_activation"></a>

In order for any FE license to be activated on a terminal, that terminal must receive a licensing token that will allow the OS to turn on the feature. Tokens can be tied to either a device serial number or a particular sponsor certificate.

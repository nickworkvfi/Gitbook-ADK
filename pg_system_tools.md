# System Tools



This document describes tools available for external use. These tools are intended for use by Terminal Sponsors. All these tools are installation packages that can be downloaded locally or remotely to the terminals to apply changes. These packages must be signed by the User Sponsor using the same tools as for signing software. Users of these tools are responsible for using them according to their specific needs.

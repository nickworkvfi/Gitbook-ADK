# Touchscreen Usage Rules



For devices that have a touchscreen (for example, a P400) the end user needs to follow the general touchscreen terms of use. Sometimes touch screen might not respond as you expect it to, so, the following tips may help with this problem.



* Use your fingertip to press icons on the touchscreen.
* Do not use sharp or pointed objects (e.g. pens, pencils, golf tees, etc.) to press icons on the touchscreen.
* Do not use gloves to press icons on the touchscreen.
* Keep the touchscreen clean and free of fingerprints by using a dry microfibre cloth to wipe down the touchscreen.
* Do not use liquid cleaning agents, such as glass cleaner, on the touchscreen.
